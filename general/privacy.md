## ðŸ”µ Software
There are currently two (2) releases of ImageGlass: "Microsoft Store" and "Classic". The Microsoft Store release is available on Microsoft Store while the Classic release is downloadable from this website.

Both releases of ImageGlass will anonymously append a query string when you open a link from the software to this website. This allows us to count how many installations there are for each version of ImageGlass, and how many install/update attempts were successful or not.
