## New image formats support
`AVIF`, `JP2`, `CR3`, and `HEIF` are added to built-in formats list. If you are upgrading from older version, you may need to manually add these formats in Settings > File type associations tab.

You also can add other formats listed at https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php#supported


## EXIF viewer tool
This new tool helps you view EXIF metadata of the viewing image, copy selected value, and export all data to a text file.

Exif tool in ImageGlass is a wrapper of https://exiftool.org, developed by Phil Harvey. You need to download the Windows executable version on its website, unzip and rename `exiftool(-k).exe` to `exiftool.exe`. Then, import this file to ImageGlass by going to Settings > Tools > Exif tool, clicking on Select Exif tool file link button.

## Page Navigation tool supports for GIF
You can step through GIF frame-by-frame with the Page Navigation tool. Combining with the available features, you can select and save a particular frame of GIF, pause and resume the animation, or export all frames to files.


## Faster loading time for RAW formats
ImageGlass Kobe uses OpenMP version of Magick.NET library, which performs a multithreaded operation on an image to increase the performance for the 64-bit version. The obvious improvement can be seen in RAW formats. It could be two times faster.


## More customisation
ImageGlass Kobe adds more options to theme pack that allows you to change colors, replace or totally hide the default logo.

For full details, please refer to https://github.com/ImageGlass/theme

Besides, you can change the size of toolbar button in Settings > Toolbar. This is useful for those who work on large screens, or touch devices.
