## Official Discord server
We just launched a Discord server for ImageGlass where you can chat to the other fellows, or ask a question..., please feel free to join in: http://discord.io/imageglass


## JPEG XL format support
JXL format is now added to the built-in list. If you are upgrading from older version, you may need to manually add these formats in Settings > File type associations tab.

You also can add other formats listed at https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php#supported


## EXIF viewer tool improvement
Exif tool in ImageGlass is a wrapper of https://exiftool.org, developed by Phil Harvey. You need to download the Windows executable version on its website, unzip and rename `exiftool(-k).exe` to `exiftool.exe`. Then, import this file to ImageGlass by going to Settings > Tools > Exif tool, clicking on Select Exif tool file link button.

In this update, you can pass custom parameters to the exiftool, by going to Settings > Tools > Exif tool > Command arguments, and you can see the preview of the command in the Command preview box.


## More interpolation options for Zoom Optimization
We implemented this feature according to a request. For those who need professional zooming feature, you can check the new options added: Low / high quality, Bilinear, Bicubic, Nearest-neighbor,...


## Save image vs Save image as...
We made a breaking change for saving method of ImageGlass 8.1. "Save image" will override the current viewing image file (if possible) while "Save image as..." will always open Save file dialog. When you work with image data (clipboard), "Save image" works as "Save image as..." feature.
