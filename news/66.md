# Critical Update: ImageGlass 6.0.12.29

ImageGlass 6.0.12.29 is released to address some critical bugs reported:
- Cannot check for update.
- The Flip Horizontal/Vertical menu are untranslated

This version also comes with MSI builds. However, we removed the feature Set as Lock screen image from these MSI builds due to some limitations.

To enable it, after installing MSI build, you can copy these files (from Portable version) to the installed folder:
- igcmdWin10.exe
- System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime.dll
- Windows.winmd
