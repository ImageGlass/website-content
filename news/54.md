# Support for Windows XP and Windows Vista will end after ImageGlass 4

Due to [end of support from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/lifecycle/faq/windows), Windows XP and Windows Vista will not be no longer supported since ImageGlass 5. The upcoming ImageGlass 4, will be the last version works on these versions of Windows OS.


## Why?
