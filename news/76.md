## Support new image formats
WEBP animated format is supported! Other formats come to this release are `FITS`, `XV`, `VIFF`, `MJPEG`,...


## New feature: Share
You can share the viewing image or even the image data that you pasted to ImageGlass by the new Share feature. It works on Windows 10 or later. You can find this feature in **Main menu > File > Share..**., or press the hotkey <kbd>S</kbd>.


## Support for image transparency copy/paste
In the previous versions, ImageGlass was unable to copy the alpha pixels to clipboard, or display it from clipboard paste function. Managing clipboard data in Windows is complicated and inconsistent, version 8.6 supports the most common way to support this by writing / reading from 4 clipboard data formats: `CF_BITMAP`, `CF_DIB`, `PNG`, `System.Drawing.Bitmap`. For those third-party softwares support writing / reading `PNG`, `CF_DIB` from the clipboard, its image transparency data will work on ImageGlass 8.6.


## Customize image panning speed
Image panning speed customization is supported in the version 8.6, a big thank to [@Solomon Blount](https://github.com/siblount)'s contribution. You can change it in **Settings > Image > Panning**.

Besides that, in the Windows fit mode, when you zoom the viewing image, the window size is also scaled to adapt the image size accordingly - an awesome contribution from [@Sylwester ZarÄ™bski](https://github.com/SylwesterZarebski)! ImageGlass 8.6 also contains bug fixes to make it works better on Windows 11.
