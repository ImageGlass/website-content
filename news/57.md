ImageGlass keeps getting better - the version 4 includes new innovations, features and bug fixes. 

## A minimal clean modern appearance!
ImageGlass 4 now looks good on a high resolution monitor with a new modern dark UI.
You don't like the default dark theme? No worries, there are a lot of [other beautiful theme packs](https://imageglass.org/themes)!


## New image formats supported
ImageGlass 4 supports up to [30 common image formats](https://imageglass.org/docs/supported-formats).

In additional, ImageGlass 4 switches to use ImageMagick library which allows user view over [100+ image formats](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php#supported). You can add new format easily by a friendly UI in Settings dialog. You may need to install some dependent softwares to be able to read those new formats.


## Edit viewing image with your favorite apps
ImageGlass is purely image viewing app.
We understand you want to use the best tools to edit your photos and we believe that every image format has its own editing tools. ImageGlass proudly provides you a quick command to edit the viewing image.

By pressing Ctrl + E, ImageGlass will immediately open the associated app. You are able to change the associated app easily in the Settings dialog.


## Enhanced drag-drop features
You can drag any photos to view; or hold Ctrl key and drag the viewing image to any apps to open it instantly.
