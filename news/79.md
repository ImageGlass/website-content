## Changes for Magick.NET library
ImageGlass has been using Magick.NET Q16 to read the image formats since version 4.0. In version 8.7, we changed to [Magick.NET Q16-HDRI](https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET/tree/main/docs#q8-q16-or-q16-hdri) for more precise and better quality output. As a result, it requires a bit more memory for reading the image because it uses a floating point (32 bits-per-pixel component) and allows out-of-bound pixels (less than 0 and more than 65,535).

This change applies to the 64-bit release of ImageGlass 8.7. If you need a more lightweight version, you can download the 32-bit release.


## Support dark mode for title bar
Version 8.7 adds an option to theme pack config file (igconfig.xml) to enable dark (or light) mode of the title bar. You should [update your theme packs](https://imageglass.org/themes) to enjoy the seamless color in the app.

To learn more about the theme pack, you can visit: https://github.com/ImageGlass/theme.


## Support setting sub-second slideshow interval
In version 8.6, you can only set the slideshow interval by a second. [The contribution of @BenHUET](https://github.com/d2phap/ImageGlass/pull/1393) makes it possible to use milliseconds for the slideshow interval. You can enter a decimal number into the slideshow interval textbox, click OK or Apply button to apply the change.
